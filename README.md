> epub2tts-chatterbox is a free and open source python app to easily create a full-featured audiobook from an epub or text file using realistic voice-cloning text-to-speech by [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox). CUDA compatible GPU is required, or Apple silicone.

## üöÄ Features

- [x] Creates standard format M4B audiobook file
- [x] Automatic chapter break detection
- [x] Embeds cover art if specified
- [x] Resumes where it left off if interrupted
- [x] NOTE: epub file must be DRM-free


## üìñ Usage
<details>
<summary> Usage instructions</summary>

*NOTE:* If you want to specify where NLTK tokenizer will be stored (about 50mb), use an environment variable: `export NLTK_DATA="your/path/to/nltk_data"`

## OPTIONAL - activate the virutal environment if using
1. `source .venv/bin/activate`

## FIRST - extract epub contents to text and cover image to png:
1. `epub2tts-chatterbox mybook.epub`
2. **edit mybook.txt**, replacing `# Part 1` etc with desired chapter names, and removing front matter like table of contents and anything else you do not want read. **Note:** First two lines can be Title: and Author: to use that in audiobook metadata.

## Read text to audiobook:

* `epub2tts-chatterbox mybook.txt --cover mybook.png --sample <speaker sample>`
* Specify a speaking sample with `--sample <speaker>`. Ideally your speaking sample should be 30-60 seconds long and can be WAV or MP3 (or a few other formats I don't recall). Sample should be clean audio, no background music or sounds.


## All options
* `-h, --help` - show this help message and exit
* `--sample SampleAudioFile` - Speaker sample to use (example: george.wav)
* `--cover image.[jpg|png]` - Image to use for cover
* `--notitles` - Do not read chapter titles when creating audiobook

## Deactivate virtual environment
`deactivate`

## üì¶ Install

Required Python version is 3.11.

*NOTE:* If you want to specify where NLTK tokenizer will be stored (about 50mb), use an environment variable: `export NLTK_DATA="your/path/to/nltk_data"`

<details>
<summary>MAC INSTALLATION</summary>

This installation requires Python < 3.12 and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (I use homebrew to install espeak, [pyenv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36968425/how-can-i-install-multiple-versions-of-python-on-latest-os-x-and-use-them-in-par) and ffmpeg).

```
#install dependencies
brew install mecab espeak pyenv ffmpeg
#install epub2tts-chatterbox
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-chatterbox
cd epub2tts-chatterbox
pyenv install 3.11
pyenv local 3.11
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>LINUX INSTALLATION</summary>

These instructions are for Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and 22.04  (20.04 showed some depedency issues), but should work (with appropriate package installer mods) for just about any distro. Ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed before use.

```
#install dependencies
sudo apt install espeak-ng ffmpeg python3-venv
#clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts-chatterbox
cd epub2tts-chatterbox
#OPTIONAL - install this in a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>WINDOWS INSTALLATION</summary>

Running epub2tts in WSL2 with Ubuntu 22 is the easiest approach, but these steps should work for running directly in windows.

1. Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Download the installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ then run the downloaded file `vs_BuildTools.exe` and select the "C++ Build tools" checkbox leaving all options at their default value. **Note:** This will require about 7 GB of space on C drive.
2. Install espeak-ng from https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/latest
3. [Install chocolaty](https://chocolatey.org/install)
4. Install ffmpeg with the command `choco install ffmpeg`, make sure you are in an elevated powershell session.
5. Install python 3.11 with the command `choco install python311`
6. Install git with the command `choco install git`.
7. Decide where you want your epub2tts project to live, documents is a common place. Once you've found a directory you're happy with, clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/aedocw/epub2tts` and cd epub2tts so you're now in your working directory.
8. There are probably a few different ways you can go here, I personally opted for a venv to keep everything organized. Create a venv with the command `python -m venv .venv`
9. Activate the venv, on windows the command is slightly different as you issue `.venv\scripts\activate`
10. Install epub2tts along with the requirements with the commands `pip install .`

11. If all goes well, you should be able to call epub2tts from within your venv and update it from this directory going forward. To update, use `git pull` and then `pip install . --upgrade`

Using GPU:
1. For checkig if do you use GPU run `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.version.cuda); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
2. If you get false you need to install compatibile torch version for your drivers (you can check it with `nvidia-smi`):
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip uninstall -y torch torchvision torchaudio`
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --no-cache-dir --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128`
  - Do the first step again for checking results.
3. If you are getting torchaudio version error on running app you need to change it in `METADATA` file in `.venv\Lib\site-packages\chatterbox_tts-0.1.2.dist-info`

## Updating

<details>
<summary>UPDATING YOUR INSTALLATION</summary>

1. cd to repo directory
2. `git pull`
3. Activate virtual environment you installed epub2tts in if you installed in a virtual environment using "source .venv/bin/activate"
4. `pip install . --upgrade`
